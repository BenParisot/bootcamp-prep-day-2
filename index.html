    <h1>Welcome to my new website!</h1>
    <p>Hellooooooo, world! You look gorgeous today.</p>
    <p>Here's what I love about live-updating:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Seeing my updates live.</li>
            <li>That's about it.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Ooooh, that's neat</p>
    <h3>snip snip bish</h3>
    <p>HTML is semantic. It helps us understand the structure of the content better. It doesn't tell us how to the present the content. We use CSS for that.</p>
