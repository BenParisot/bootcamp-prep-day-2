    <h1>A Couple of Place Holders</h1>
    <p>The pundits, the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But we also know our conscience cannot rest so long as the war goes on in Iraq. I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. The attacks of September 11th, 2001 and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view Islam as inevitably hostile not only to America and Western countries, but also to human rights. There must be a sustained effort to listen to each other; to learn from each other; to respect one another; and to seek common ground. It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra; our magnetic compass and tools of navigation; our mastery of pens and printing; our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed.</p>
