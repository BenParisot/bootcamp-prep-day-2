    <h1>Welcome to my new website!</h1>
    <p>Hellooooooo, world! You look gorgeous today.</p>
    <p>Here's what I love about live-updating:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Seeing my updates live.</li>
            <li>That's about it.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Ooooh, that's neat</p>
    <h3>snip snip bish</h3>
    <p>HTML is semantic. It helps us understand the structure of the content better. It doesn't tell us how to the present the content. We use CSS for that.</p>
    <p>This is a new paragraph babe. <strong>Get with it.</strong></p>
    <p>This is how I <em>write very important things.</em> Deal with it.</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>This is an unordered list babe.</li>
            <li>What else can I list in this list?</li>
            <li>Anything I freakin' want dude.</li>
            <li>Again: <strong>DEAL WITH IT.</strong></li>
            <li>Say you wanna go to <a target="blank" href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>. Well just click that link right there lil buddy.</li>
        </ul>
